# Predictions using Gradio
This project includes a simple web application using Gradio to make predictions based on user input.

## Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:
- 'git clone https://github.com/daniellewright196/housing-mlops-basic.git'
- 'cd housing-mlops-basic'

## Install dependencies: Make sure you have Python installed, then run:
'pip install -r requirements.txt'

Or just install Gradio manually:
'pip install gradio joblib numpy'

Make sure 'model.pkl' (generated by 'train.py') is in the root directory of the project. 
If itâ€™s missing, run:
'python train.py'

Launch the web app:
'python app.py'

This will start a Gradio interface in your browser at http://localhost:7860.

## What the App Does
The app allows users to input:
- Square footage (area)
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
- Uses a trained linear regression model to predict the estimated housing price in real time.
